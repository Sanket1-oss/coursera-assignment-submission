	<h1> dal tadka</h1>
	<p>Dal (also spelled daal; pronunciation: [d̪aːl]) is a term used in the Indian subcontinent for dried, split pulses (that is, lentils, peas, and beans) that do not require pre-soaking. The term is also used for various soups prepared from these pulses. These pulses are among the most important staple foods in South Asian countries, and form an important part of the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent.[1]

	<h1> nan</h1>
	<p>Naan in parts of the Indian subcontinent usually refers to a specific kind of thick flatbread (another well-known kind of flatbread is chapati). Generally, it resembles pita and, like pita bread, is usually leavened with yeast or with bread starter (leavened naan dough left over from a previous batch); unleavened dough (similar to that used for roti) is also used. Naan is cooked in a tandoor, from which tandoori cooking takes its name.
